# Clyde Providers
Custom edited providers for use with Clyde.<br>
You will need a copy of [gpt4free](https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free) and [python-tgpt](https://github.com/Simatwa/python-tgpt) set up with an instance of [Clyde](https://github.com/ClydeReborn/Clyde) to use these.

## Installation Paths
- g4f: `path/to/venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/g4f/Provider/NAME.py`<br>
- python-tgpt: `path/to/venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pytgpt/NAME/main.py`

Putting these outside of your module path will not do anything.
